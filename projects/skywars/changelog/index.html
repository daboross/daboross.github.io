This greatly reduces server load caused by games starting and stopping, eliminating virtually all server lag caused by SkyWars. <ul><li>The parameters of this method can be tweaked by adjusting the &quot;time-before-start-to-start-arena-copy-operation&quot; and &quot;number-of-blocks-to-copy-at-once&quot; options in the configuration. To disable, set &quot;time-before-start-to-start-arena-copy-operation&quot; to &quot;-1&quot;.</li><li>When enabled, SkyWars will perform the arena operations in evenly spaced operations, starting at &quot;time-before-start-to-start-arena-copy-operation&quot;, and ending exactly when the game starts. Each operation will copy &quot;number-of-blocks-to-copy-at-once&quot; blocks, and the number of operations is calculated based on how big each arena is.</li></ul></li></ul><p>While this version only contains two features, there have been many internal changes made to accommodate these two additions, and I hope these two features will greatly expand the use case and usefulness of the plugin.</p><h2>2.1.7</h2><h3>SkyWars:</h3><ul><li>Fix bug introduced in v2.1.6 where chest randomization does not fill any chests.</li><li>Add secondary plugin statistics system, reporting to <a href=http://daboross.net>http://daboross.net</a><ul><li>I meant to wait until v2.2.0 to include plugin-statistics, but this bugfix release needs to happen, and since the statistics is done I thought I might as well include it now.</li><li>For details on what data is reported, and how to opt out, see statistics section of <a href=http://daboross.net/projects/skywars/ >http://daboross.net/projects/skywars/</a>, or &quot;report-statistics&quot; option in <a href=http://daboross.net/projects/skywars/configuring-skywars>http://daboross.net/projects/skywars/configuring-skywars</a>.</li><li>To see recorded data (the same data I have access to), see <a href=http://daboross.net/statistics/skywars/ >http://daboross.net/statistics/skywars/</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>2.1.6</h2><h3>SkyWars:</h3><ul><li>Fix kit messages &amp; GUI being shown to those without the skywars.kit permission</li><li>Fix right clicking on join signs not doing anything</li><li>Add full support for all MC 1.9 variations of potions in custom arenas.</li><li>Fix potions not working in kits and random chests in MC 1.9+.</li><li>Fix armor not being applied in kits on MC 1.9+.</li><li>Fix tab completion for all SkyWars commands with arguments (/sw kit, etc.)</li><li>Fix multiple possible NullPointerExceptions errors when: <ul><li>team mode is enabled, and a game is started without the maximum number of players</li><li>checking player interactions with other plugins</li><li>a player leaves the server while in a game</li><li>kits with no non-armor inventory items are used</li></ul></li><li>Fix errors starting arena when: <ul><li>random chests with a high total level are used</li><li>double chests are placed in a custom arena</li></ul></li><li>Fix random chest configuration sections only being created for regular chests, not trapped chests</li><li>Fix errors on leaving game when maximum player health is increased by armor or other items.</li><li>Fix outdated WorldEdit versions causing glitches in SkyWars.</li><li>Fix chests in custom arenas on Glowstone</li><li>Remove UUID warning message on Glowstone and other non-CraftBukkit servers when UUIDs are supported</li></ul><h3>SkyWars-Translations:</h3><ul><li>Make all game message punctuation consistent between all translated languages.</li></ul><h2>2.1.5</h2><h3>SkyWars:</h3><ul><li>Add support for limiting start/win/death in an arena to only players in that arena <ul><li>Enable death-message-limiting by default - deaths in game will only be displayed to those in that game.</li></ul></li><li>Fix players without the <code>skywars.join</code> permission being able to use join signs</li><li>Implement an inventory-based kit-choosing GUI. <ul><li>Each kit now has a &quot;totem,&quot; and &quot;description&quot; configuration setting, which are used as the display item and lore for the kit in the kitGUI, respectively.</li><li>Add configuration options to display kit gui...:</li><li>with a <code>/sw kitgui</code> command</li><li>with the <code>/sw kit</code> command (replacing the command kit interface completely)</li><li>or, automatically whenever joining the queue (or clicking a join sign when already in the queue)</li><li>The <code>/sw kitgui</code> and automatic-showing are enabled by default for players with the <code>skywars.kitgui</code> permission (OP-only by default)</li></ul></li><li>Fix <code>/sw report</code> not working with the new <code>is.gd</code> API changes.</li><li>Fix players always facing one direction when teleporting to the lobby. SkyWars now correctly applies the pitch/yaw.</li></ul><h3>SkyWars-API:</h3><ul><li>Allow more optimization for the final SkyWars plugin jar file. This means a possibly faster and definitely smaller jar, but if you&#39;ve been depending on SkyWars.jar from another plugin, this may break that dependency.</li><li>Note that as long as you are depending on SkyWars-API.jar, and using all the public interfaces defined in that, you&#39;ll be fine. All of the API interfaces and methods are exempt from the optimization, and will work fine in any setting.</li></ul><h2>2.1.4</h2><h3>SkyWars:</h3><ul><li>Add join signs with auto-updating queue information.
